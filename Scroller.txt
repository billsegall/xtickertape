The Scroller records both ends of a doubly-linked list of
glyph_holders.  These represent the messages currently visible in the
scroller.

The glyph_holders, in turn, hold pointers to glyphs.  The glyphs
comprise a doubly-linked, circular queue corresponding to the messages
to display in the scroller.  Glyphs are removed from this queue when
they expire unless they're still visible.  The glyph queue is never
empty; it always contains at least the gap.

If a glyph is replaced by a more recent version of a message, it is
linked to the original message in a predecessor/successor
doubly-linked list.  The ultimate successor must remain in the
circular queue while one of its predecessors is visible.  This list
need only contain visible glyphs and the ultimate successor; there can
be two visible glyphs and one successor, so the maximum length should
never exceed three.
